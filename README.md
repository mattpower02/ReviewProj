Summary:
When planning this project, we wanted to create a program that would not only help students visualize what their grade is, but ask input from the user and see if the student is doing as well as they would hope. We also decided to implement a feature in our program that will tell a student what they should do depending on the grades in their class. For example, if they have low grades in assignments, we recommend they go to office hours to seek help from TAs and master the content for that class. Another exaemple, if the student is strugglingn on tests, we recommend they study more before the tests and possibly join a study group.
